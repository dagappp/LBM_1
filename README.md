# Lattice Boltzmann Method 
Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is a numerical technique used for simulating fluid dynamics and other complex physical phenomena. The model represented LBM diffusion in 2D space based on the LGA (Lattice Gas Automata) method. This time, I used the D2Q9 velocity model scheme, which consists of nine directions. The model area was divided by a wall with an opening.
